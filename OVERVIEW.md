1. Reliability/performance on mobile
	•	Treat mobile as mission-critical field software, not a marketing surface:
	•	Offline-first capture (queue uploads)
	•	Aggressive photo pipeline optimization
	•	Deterministic memory limits and scroll virtualization
	•	“Safe mode” when caches corrupt (no reinstall required)
	•	Build around a field journal core:
	•	Offline capture + background sync
	•	Local albums + bulk metadata tools
	•	Fast thumbnailing and progressive image loading
	•	Compete on “it never fails in the woods.”

2. Data rights + AI use: users want portability and enforceable consent boundaries
	•	Create portable “consent profiles”:
	•	“No AI training anywhere”
	•	“Noncommercial research OK”
	•	“Everything OK under CC BY”
	•	Make it machine-readable and propagate it through API, exports, and partner feeds.
	•	Offer temporary withdrawal / escrow (a reversible protest mechanism), instead of account deletion being the only lever.
	•	Build “data sovereignty” as a differentiator:
	•	Per-observation and per-media policy tags
	•	Cryptographic provenance + policy enforcement in exports
	•	One-click migration bundles (your full history, IDs, comments, media, plus policy metadata)

3. Developer ecosystem: third-party apps want real APIs and stable CV access
    •	Win by being the platform layer:
	•	Clean APIs, generous quotas, and clear licensing
	•	Optional hosted CV inference
	•	App marketplace / plugin architecture
	•	Monetize via hosted services, not by locking up the commons.

4. Serious Casuals
	•	quick ID + confidence
	•	lightweight contribution
	•	minimal social complexity
	•	better “what’s near me / trends / seasons” views
